Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
The motivation that drove the group to make the application was the desire to make a more appealing and user friendly movie application then whatâ€™s currently on the market.

- What problem does it solve? 
Brings a simplistic and user friendly movie database to the user.

- What did you learn?
 I got better with Server side API's, as well as hide/display in HTML (onclick) and their relative functions in JavaScript.
